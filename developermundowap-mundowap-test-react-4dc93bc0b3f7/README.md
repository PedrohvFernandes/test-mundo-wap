## Starting a React Server

This tutorial provides instructions on how to start a React server, whether using Docker or the direct command line.

### Using Docker

1.  Run the `start_server.sh` script placed on root of project or copy the content of script and execute on your console.
2.  To stop container, run `stop_server.sh` script placed on root of project or copy the content of script and execute on your console.

### Using Command Line

1.  Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of your React project.
2.  Install Node.js and Yarn (if not installed):

If you haven't installed Node.js and Yarn, you can follow these steps:

- Install Node.js: Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

- Install Yarn: Once Node.js is installed, you can install Yarn using npm (Node Package Manager) with the following command:

`npm install -g yarn`

1.  Execute the following commands:

`yarn && yarn start`

This will install the project dependencies and start the React server.

You can now access your React application at `http://localhost:3000`.
